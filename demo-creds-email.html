Welcome to the PNDA-on-MemCloud Demo. Here are your credentials:

There are a couple of steps involved to get connected:

Step 1: Get OpenVPN access to MemCloud.  There are three steps:
      (1) Download VPN client
      (2) Install VPN client
      (3) Add VPN profile, see Step 2

       For MacOS, Windows and Linux users, there is a separate set of Step 1 instructions, which can be found here: https://goo.gl/dUKtWq

Step 2: Download, add your VPN profile, found here: {{params.ovpnlink | safe }}

Step 3: User has to add the IP address for the PNDA instance names

      Linux: Add the below entryies in  /etc/hosts file
      Windows: Add the below entry in  C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts file

{{params.accesurl[ 0 ]

   	{%	for node in params.accessurl	%}
      		[eth0 IP of {{node[0]}}  node   : {{node[1]}} ] {{node[2]}}							
	{%	endfor	%}

Step 4: After establishing VPN you can access PNDA:
      Access to PNDA â€“ {{params.accessurl[0][1] }}  //IP address of the edge node
      username: pnda     //hard coded value
      password: pnda     //hard coded value


Use within the next {{params.lease}} hours. Enjoy the ride!
